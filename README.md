# image-denoising

A simple GUI application to denoising a random image by using 2D Fourier Transformation algorithm

Required Environment: Python2.7, Numpy, Pillow, OpenGL

In this GUI, you should also apply different filter(s) to the image to see how the filters effect on image.

A little demo:

Here I used a sober filter to perform edge detection on a random input image. You could also observe the Fourier/Inverse Fourier Transformation of the image in the GUI. You can change to other filters to investigate the denoising performance. Other demos are in the link below
